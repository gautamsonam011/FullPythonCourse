What is Pickle in python:----------->

The Pickle module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and de-serializing 
a Python object structure.

Storing Data with pickle:------------>

You can pickle objects with the following data types:-

1:- Booleans
2:- Integer
3:- Float
4:- Complex numbers
5:- (normal and Unicode)Strings,
6:- Tuples,
7:- Lists,
8:- Sets and
9:- Dictionaries

Pickle files:--------------->

To use pickle, start by importing it in python.

import pickle

pickle has two main methods. The first one is dump, which dump, which dumps an object to a file object and
the second one is load, which loads an object from a file object.

Python pickle functions:-

dump() -> This function is called to serialize an object hierarchy.
load() -> This function is called to de-serialize a data stream

wb => Data Write
rb => Data Read
